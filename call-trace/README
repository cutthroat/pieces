A very rudimentary way to trace function calls in GCC compiled application.

Mainly an exercise in Haskell scripting and I/O.

CallTrace.hs uses the 'addr2line' tool from GNU Binutils.

TODO:
* it would be nice to implement the things in
    http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-graphvis/
* more efficient IO between the instrumented executable and the CallTrace tool
