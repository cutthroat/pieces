A short script to collect Calvin and Hobbes comic strips


COLLECT

>> ./calvin.py [start_date] [end_date]

The date format is YYYY-MM-DD. The default date is today. Images are saved as
YYYY-MM-DD<ext>. Execution is recorded in the log file named log. The script
doesn't overwrite existing files.

Two regular expressions are used to fetch the date and the zoom image url from
the strip page.


LOG

Each line of the log file is of the form:

    <DATE> <URL> <EXT>

If no image had been obtained then <URL> and <EXT> are both None.


VERIFY

>> ./verify.py

In case you are paranoid the verify script compares all images from the log
with their remote counterparts.
